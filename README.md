## Inspiration
We wanted to create an app that can help students with their studying. 

Realizing that many common studying-related functions are scattered in multiple programs, we decided to create an app that would meet all those needs in one place.

## What it does
StudyBuddy is a web application that consolidates several handy studying-related functionalities into one site. You can make flashcards to quiz yourself, schedule and keep track of homework and tests, and set timers to keep your studying on track.

## How we built it
We used the Django REST framework for the backend, and React for the frontend.

## Challenges we ran into
Using Django and REST API for the backend proved to be a hurdle, as none of us were particularly experienced with it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting a working product done, complete with a front and back-end.

## What we learned
We learned how to use Django REST, and how to access the REST API via a React frontend.

## What's next for StudyBuddy
We plan on deploying this app with a few other features. Ideas include saving notes, a quiz feature, and sharing notes with friends.
